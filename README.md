An Arduino-powered, battery-driven differential-drive robot that uses a 6-axis MPU6050 IMU for real-time heading estimation and closed-loop control. Users define any combination of straight segments, arcs or complex curves, and the onboard proportional controller continuously adjusts each wheel’s speed—speeding one side up and slowing the other—to keep the robot precisely on its intended path. With minimal hardware requirements, modular wiring, and simple I²C communication, this platform is ideal for hands-on learning in mobile robotics, sensor fusion, and control theory.
